Course 3104

This course includes a wide range of topics and gives a student an idea about what a DevOps engineer
does. In our course, the tool that is used the most is GitBASH. The course explains how and why are the 
development tools used and what is the purpose behind it. There will be a lot of terms that we'll learn in the
course and the commonly used are - DevOps, BASH, Terminal, Node, Build, Build process, CD/CI pipeline etc.

It has allowed a lot of businesses to work independently and quickly as compared to the previous times because 
the process was time consuming earlier than now. To introduce this subject is a great way to teach students 
about the present and future of DevOps because it introduces us with a wide range of topics and tools such as-
Git, Github, GitBASH, Version Control System, Single Page Application etc. and our hands on lab work helps us 
practice it which can be used not only for front end but also back end. Creating repositories, working with Travis, 
understanding BASH commands, understanding pipeline sequences etc. has provided me great knowledge and the deeper we 
dive into the course, new topics unflod which in turn will help the students grow in their field.
