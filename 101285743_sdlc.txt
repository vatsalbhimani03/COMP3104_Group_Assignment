Software Development Life Cycle

It is a methodology to create high quality software with as low cost as possible in very short
period of time and focuses on planning, testing, development,software design (architectural design), 
software development etc. which are known to be the phases of software development.

The most popular models of SDLC are waterfall model, agile model and spiral model. Even though the
cost is lowered, the quality continuously improves and the production time is shortened in SDLC. Such goals
are achieved by careful planning which removes the typical pitfalls of software development projects. It starts
by evaluating the systems which already exist and check for any deficiences. Then the requirements of the new 
system are defined through the different stages. The testing phase has the most foucs as they have to make sure 
the code quality is not compromised. Because SDLC is a repetitive methodology, the code quality matters a lot 
especially because of competition in the market and it could save a lot of time and money with the right effort.

The process works when you are aware what is the current problem and then create a plan and design the same which 
gives an idea about the resources available and the cost as per the requirements. The team should also be aware of 
the risks associated while building. After the code is built, it needs to be tested and if it meets the requirements,
the next step is software deployment, which allows the stakeholders to experiment with the product before it is being
released into the market to make sure any last minute mistakes don't appear.
