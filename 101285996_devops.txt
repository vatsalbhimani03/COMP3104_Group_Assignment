Information About Course COMP3104

This Course will be finishing with concepts and knowledge needed for interviews and environments where you may be exposed to the concepts of Devops.
The chances are quite high given the current market demand for this type of knowledge. 
This course won’t make you a DevOps engineer, but it will shine some light in a part of the industry that developers will soon have to become much more familiar with. 
Whether you’re a front-end developer working with a QA (Quality Assurance) analyst, a back-end developer working with Senior Architects or a network administrator supporting infrastructure, you will need to know the terminology commonly used and what’s considered to be best practices when it comes to successfully shipping software.
Along with some of the tools mentioned, we’ll also be leveraging and exploring some of the underlying protocols which make working with servers a cinch.
This will remove some of the magic from the tools we use. Along with some lower-level knowledge, our intention is to spawn new ideas and explore creative solutions to common problems.
