George Brown College

George Brown college is a well known college specifically for students who opt IT and fashion because
they are the most popular fields from all the options provided (according to the information and reviews I've got until now).
It is the first college to start distance education and students from all over the world has participated.
It is located in Ontario, Canada and has three campuses- Casa Loma, St. James and Waterfront. Each
one of them is uniquely built and worth exploring.

George Brown College has been a dream of many students and I feel myself lucky to be a part of this 
institute. When I shared with people that I am attending George Brown, a lot of people gave me so many
positive responses and reviews that the locals as well as international immigrants believe that the college is
well reputed and focuses on students. It has given me a lot of experiences and memories which I will cherish for life.
I joined in September 2019, in Computer programmer Analyst course for which the campus is Casa Loma.
The building and the classes can be confusing to find for the very first week but you get used to it.
The in-person classes, cafeteria, popcorn day, gymnasium, game room for badminton, cricket etc. everything
is so much fun and the time spent there was totally worth it. With the pandemic situation, no
such activities can take place and the classes cannot gather anymore but I look forward to attend
the college in person and re-connect with everyone.
