George Brown College has been a dream of many students and I feel myself lucky to be a part of this 
institute. It has given me a lot of experiences and memories which I will cherish for life.
I joined in September 2019, in Computer programmer Analyst course for which the campus is Casa Loma.
The building and the classes can be confusing to find for the very first week but you get used to it.
The in-person classes, cafeteria, popcorn day, gymnasium, game room for badminton, cricket etc. everything
is so much fun and the time spent there was totally worth it. With the pandemic situation, no
such activities can take place and the classes cannot gather anymore but I look forward to attend
the college in person and re-connect with everyone.
